Explanation:
Here's a complete example of a C++ code for an Arduino Uno to read a 400Hz PWM signal 
and control a motor position using an L298 stepper driver. This code uses the pulseIn 
function to measure the PWM signal's duty cycle and maps it to a 0-255 range for motor
position control.

Setup and Initialization:	
The Stepper library and necessary variables are initialized.
The PWM input pin is set to pwmPin.
The stepper motor is set up with the number of steps per revolution and the control pins 
connected to the L298 driver.

Loop:
The pulseIn function measures the high and low times of the PWM signal.
The duty cycle is calculated based on the high time divided by the total period.
The duty cycle is then mapped to a motor position range of 0 to 255.
The stepper motor moves to the new position based on the mapped value.
A small delay is added to avoid rapid changes in motor position.
This code will read a 400Hz PWM signal and control the stepper motor position accordingly.
Make sure to adjust the stepsPerRevolution and motor speed (myStepper.setSpeed) as needed 
for your specific stepper motor and application.
